## Objectives
* To accurately recognise the text contained in the image uploaded.
* To provide accurate translations for both target languages.
* To provide appropriate translation, with respect to using region specific and colloquial words in the translations.
* To have a flexible dataset which can be altered to suit any use case by appending or deleting words/sentences provided in the dataset for translation.
* To make our project applicable to many real-life based use cases by achieving objective 4 (having flexible datasets).

## Objectives completed 
  1. Accuracy achieved:
      Translation to French: 93.76%
      Translation to Spanish: 96.86%

  2. Since the datasets are stored in .txt file format, they can be infinitely edited to suit multiple use cases such as:
        A program that translates ancient texts or manuscripts.
        Travel-based translator to help people communicate when they are abroad.
        Digitisation of documents in several languages in order to go paperless.
        A system which converts handwritten text into digital format and translates it into audio for visually impaired individuals, enabling them to access and understand written content.
